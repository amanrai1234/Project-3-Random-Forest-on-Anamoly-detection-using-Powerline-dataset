# Project-3-Random-Forest-on-Anamoly-detection-using-Powerline-dataset




In this task we are given the dataset of the powerline and we have to fit the 
dataset on the random forest classifier, support vector machine and decision tree 
classifier and then evaluated the results using confusion matrix.

Dataset:

The powerline dataset is being loaded using pandas and as mentioned in the task 
it is being split using the stratified split.
Visualization and Scaling:

In this I used pandas Head and tail to visualize the dataset values and here we 
notice that the dataset has numerical values so these values need to be scaled, 
because of this I performed scaling in the dataset.

Fitting the Models and Evaluation:

1]To do SVM classification I used scikit learn classifier and fitted the model
with the scaled values and then I evaluated the result using confusion matrix.

2] To do random forest classification I used scikit learn classifier and fitted the 
model with the scaled values and then I evaluated the result using confusion 
matrix.

3] To do decision tree classification I used scikit learn classifier and fitted the 
model with the scaled values and then I evaluated the result using confusion
matrix
